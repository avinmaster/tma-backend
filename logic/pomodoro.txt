When I start a new timer - add a new timer to db with general_duration, duration and started_at time.
Then, start timer locally.
And if reopen website (reload local timer), check, is timer(s) finished with request.

Pause:
When user pauses timer, send request, that user paused it and modify duration and started_at times.
now=time at now
duration=started_at - now + duration
started_at=now
// finish=started_at + duration

Template:
12:32 - 25:00
duration - general_duration
